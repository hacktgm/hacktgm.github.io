      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>What is HackTGM?</h2>
          <p>HackTGM is a 24 hour student hackathon at University of Sapientia Targu Mures. We are excited to welcome students from all over to create awesome projects!</p>
          <p>Over the weekend, hackathon participants form teams of up to 4 people, and have 24 hours to build a project before presenting it to the other attendees and sponsors, after which judging takes place and prizes are handed out. Hackathons are a great opportunity for students to take their knowledge out of the classroom, experiment with new and exciting technology, and make lasting friendships with like minded people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Hacka-what?</h2>
          <p>A hackathon is best described as an ‘invention marathon’. Amongst the computing community, to hack is to build in as short a time as possible with no thought given to long-term maintenance, simply to demonstrate an idea or play around with a new technology.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How do I find a team?</h2>
          <p>Don't worry if you don't have a team! We'll find one for you. Before the hacking there will be a short event, where those without team could find other people to team up with.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Who can attend?</h2>
          <p>HackTGM is a student hackathon, and therefore you must be a current student or have graduated within the last academic year to be able to attend.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What if I'm not a coder?</h2>
          <p>You don’t have to be a coder to participate in the hackathon! You can still become a valuable team member, offering a fresh perspective, or perhaps by bringing other skills to the table such as design, data analysis or insight into user need. Hackathons are a great opportunity to learn too, it's a friendly atmosphere where attendees will help each other and share knowledge, so come along if you'd like to develop your coding skills!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Can I stay overnight?</h2>

        <li>
